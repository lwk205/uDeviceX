what parameters between different particles
add one string for each type of interactions;
string is a namespace in conf with parameters of that interaction

ex:

----
flu = {
    ...
    self = "pair_fluflu"
}

pair_fluflu = {
    dpd = true
    ...
}

rbc = {
    fsi = "pair_rbcflu"
    adhesion = "pair_adhesion"
    repulsion = "none"
}

rig = {
    fsi = "pair_rigflu"
    adhesion = "pair_fluflu"
    repulsion = "pair_repulsion"
}
