= TODO list for code

== general and simpl configuration of pairwise forces

what parameters between different particles

=== now implemented

* flu-flu (in flu)
* flu-walls (in flu; mirrored)
* flu-obj (in fsi)
* obj-obj ((in cnt)
* obj-walls (in flu)

=== Improvement?

* flu-flu (in flu)
* flu-walls (in flu; mirrored)
* flu-obj (in each obj: fsi namespace)
* obj-obj ((in cnt)
* obj-walls (in each obj: wall namespace)


== configuration of wall repulsion

Specify which object is repulsed and with what parameters

Possible conf in each object with a section repulsion...
