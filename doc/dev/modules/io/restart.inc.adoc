= restart

dump and read restart files.

== interface

Writing a single file for all ranks:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/io/restart/imp.h[tag=write]
----
<1> write particle data
<2> write integer data
<3> write rigid data

The reader functions are symmetric to the writer:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/io/restart/imp.h[tag=read]
----

The parameters are:

* a communicator of all ranks dumping or reading the file
* `code`: a string containing the directory name
* `id`: the index of dump (starting at 0). Special values can be
   passed:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/io/restart/imp.h[tag=id]
----

The _final_ and _begin_ special ids will replace the `id` part with the string
"final". It is used to dump the last restart file.
The _templ_ special id will replace the `id` part with the string
"templ". It is used for special quantities which do not change during
the whole simulation, such as wall frozen particles or rigid frozen particles.
