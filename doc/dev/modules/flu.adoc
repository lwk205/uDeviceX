= flu: solvent particles

Manages solvent particles data.

== data structure

The data is stored in a visible structure. The user can access
directly the fields.

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/flu/imp.h[tag=struct]
----

== interface

allocate and deallocate the data:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/flu/imp.h[tag=mem]
----

generate the quantities:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/flu/imp.h[tag=gen]
----
<1> generate `numberdensity` particles randomly distributed in every
    cell with zero velocity. Colors are optionally set from `GenColor`
    object (see <<>>).
<2> generate unique global ids for each particle

restart interface (see <<io_restart>>):

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/flu/imp.h[tag=start]
----
<1> read quantities from restart files
<2> dump quantities to restart files

additional tools:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/flu/imp.h[tag=tools]
----
<1> dump particles to text format, one file per MPI rank (debug purpose)
<2> build cells lists, assume that particles are inside subdomain
