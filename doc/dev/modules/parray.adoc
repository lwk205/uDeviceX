Generic particle array to be passed to interaction kernels.

== host interface

A `PaArray` structure can be configured by pushing particles and,
optionally, colors:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/parray/imp.h[tag=push]
----
WARNING: Particles must be pushed before colors

Client can check if the colors has been pushed by calling

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/parray/imp.h[tag=get]
----

The particle array data are meant to be passed to kernels.
In order to inline the fetching mode (see device interface), different
views can be generated from the `PaArray` structure:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/parray/imp.h[tag=view]
----
<1> Get a view to fetch particles without colors
<2> Get a view to fetch particles with colors


== device interface

Generic particle (see _pair_ module)  can be fetched depending on the view:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/parray/dev.h[tag=int]
----
<1> fetch position and velocity only
<2> fetch position, velocity and color
