== submodules

=== bulk

compute local interactions of solvent particles, given cell starts,
cell counts (see link:clist{lext}[clist]) and particles array

The algorithm is as follows:

* each particle of the array has one thread assigned.
* the thread runs over half of the 27 cell lists overlapping one cutoff radius
  (this makes 13 cells + the "self cell")
* in each cell, the particle ids are fetched from the cell starts
  array
* run over particles, atomic add the forces to them and gather forces
  on the main particle
* atomic add main forces to force array

Performance is strongly related to the pattern used to run over the
particles.
Better performance is achieved by grouping as much as possible
consecutive particles (row), meaning that the `x` cell index runs
fastest.

The cell run order is shown below:

----
+----> x   plane dz = -1:    plane dz =  0:    plane dz = +1:
|
|            00 01 02          09 10 11          xx xx xx
v y          03 04 05          12 13 xx          xx xx xx
             06 07 08          xx xx xx          xx xx xx
----

where `xx` denotes that the cell is not used by the current thread.

=== halo

solvent forces with remote particles (fragments)

main kernel performs interactions for a given halo:

* fetch generalized particle `a`
* build map (how to access neighboring particles?)
* loop over neighboring particles according to map
* compute pairwise interactions
* accumulate to force `a` in output force array
