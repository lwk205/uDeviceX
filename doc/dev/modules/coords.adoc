Coordinate transforms utility.
Consider three coordinate systems:

* _Global_: Relative to the lower corner of the full domain of size
   stem:[(G_x, G_y, G_z)]
* _Local_: Relative to the center of the subdomain of size
  stem:[(L_x, L_y, L_z)]
* _Center_: Relative to the center of the full domain: stem:[(C_x,
   C_y, C_z) = (G_x/2, G_y/2, G_z/2)]

== data structures

All the needed information is stored in the hidden structure `Coords`.
A _view_ structure `Coords_v` is public to device code:
