== Inflow

Mass rate inflow

=== interface

allocate, deallocate:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/control/inflow/imp.h[tags=mem]
----

initialize the inflow structure (to be done only once):

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/control/inflow/imp.h[tags=ini]
----
depending on the type of inflow, call the appropriate
`ini_params_xxx`.
`ini_velocity` must be called after initializing the parameters.
it is used to setup the inlet velocity from parameters.


create particles (at every time step):

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/control/inflow/imp.h[tags=int]
----
this will add particles to the array `pp` and increase `n` accordingly.

=== configuration

==== plate

syntax for a `8.0 x 16.0` plate perpendicular to the x axis passing by
the point `(1, 2, 3)`:

[source,cfg]
----
inflow = {
    active      = true;
    type        = "plate";
    L1          = 1.0;
    L2          = 16.0;
    direction   = 0;                # [0,1,2] = [X,Y,Z]
    origin      = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
    upoiseuille = false;            # true for parabolic profile along L1
    vpoiseuille = false;            # true for parabolic profile along L2
    u           = [10.0, 0.0, 0.0];
};
----


==== circle

syntax for cylinder:

[source,cfg]
----
inflow = {
    active = true;
    type   = "circle";
    R      = 1.0;              # radius
    H      = 16.0;             # hight of the cylinder
    U      = 1.0;              # maximum velocity
    center = [8.0, 8.0, 8.0];
    poiseuille = false;        # parabolic profile along H if true
};
