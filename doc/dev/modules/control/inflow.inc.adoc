== Inflow

Mass rate inflow

=== interface

allocate, deallocate:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/control/inflow/imp.h[tags=mem]
----

initialize the inflow structure (to be done only once):

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/control/inflow/imp.h[tags=ini]
----
depending on the type of inflow, call the appropriate
`ini_params_xxx`.
`ini_velocity` must be called after initializing the parameters.
it is used to setup the inlet velocity from parameters.


create particles (at every time step):

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/control/inflow/imp.h[tags=int]
----
this will add particles to the array `pp` and increase `n` accordingly.

=== configuration


==== circle

cylinder inflow

example:

[source,cfg]
----
inflow = {
    active = true;
    type   = "circle";
    R      = 1.0;
    H      = 16.0;
    U      = 1.0;
    center = [8.0, 8.0, 8.0];
    poiseuille = false;
};
