== Outflow

Delete particles satisfying a predicate

=== interface

allocate, deallocate:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/control/outflow/imp.h[tags=mem]
----

initialize the outflow structure (to be done only once):

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/control/outflow/imp.h[tags=ini]
----
depending on the geometry of outflow, call the appropriate
`ini_params_xxx`.


filter and mark particles (at every time step):

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/control/outflow/imp.h[tags=int]
----
<1> store dying particles infos inside Outflow struct
<2> copy from device to host number of dead particles
<3> return the list of dead marks (dead=1, alive=0)
<4> return the number of dead particles


=== configuration

==== plate

will delete particles crossing a plate along the positive direction.
syntax for the plate `y=4`:

[source,cfg]
----
outflow = {
    active     = true;
    type       = "plate";
    direction  = 1;      # [0,1,2] = [X,Y,Z]
    position   = 4.0;    # position along "direction"
};
----


==== circle

delete particles going out of the cylinder.
syntax for a cylinder of radius 8 centered at `(8, 8, 8)`:

[source,cfg]
----
outflow = {
    active = true;
    type   = "circle";
    R      = 8.0;
    center = [8.0, 8.0, 8.0];
};
