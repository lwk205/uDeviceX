= Time control

Controls time step, output, restart dumps, wall creation step.

Configuration:
tstart, tene, twall : in physical units
[rbc/flu]_dump_interval, restart_interval : in physical units

API:
  ini()/fin()
  nxt(Force*) called after every step

  [rbc/flu]_dump() : true/false
  restart()        : true/false

  dt()             : returns new timestep

How to dump/output?
  dumps are still indexed 0,1,2,...
  But TControl dumps a file `time` for every dump?
