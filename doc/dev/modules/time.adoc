= Time control

Controls time step, output, restart dumps, wall creation step.

Configuration:
tstart, tene, twall : in physical units
[rbc/flu]_dump_interval, restart_interval : in physical units
dt0: initial timestep

API:
  `ini()/fin()`
  `nxt(Force*)`      : called after every step

  `[rbc/flu]_dump()` : true/false : dump?
  `restart()`        : true/false : restart?
  `wall()`           : create a wall?

  `dt()`             : a new timestep
  `t()`              : returns a current physical time

How to dump/output?
  dumps are still indexed 0,1,2,...
  But TControl dumps a file `time` for every type of the dump?

  time of the dump 0
  time of the dump 1
  ...
  time of the dump n
