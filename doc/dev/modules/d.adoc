= generic [d]evice API

:lext: .adoc
:src: ../../../src

The goal is to make cuda API and kernel functions generic. Meaning
they can be replaced by CPU calls.

There are two groups: functions which "mirror" cuda API:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/d/api.h[tags=api]
----

functions unique for _uDeviceX_:
[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/d/api.h[tags=more]
----

files of the interface
- `d/api.h` API calls
- `d/q.h` function and variable type qualifiers
- `d/ker.h`

if `DEV_CUDA` is defined interfaces is implimented by cuda, if
`DEV_CPU` is defined it is implimented by host calls.
