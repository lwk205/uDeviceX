= Mesh

helpers for computation on triangle mesh.

Mesh are stored with an array of vertices (`vv`) or particles (`pp`) in an array of
structure fashion.
The connectivity is a set of vertices indices grouped by triangles.
For performance and convenience reasons, they are stored in a `int4`
array, each element storing ids of the three vertices of the triangle
(the last field is not used).

More complex connectivity structures are defined in appropriate
submodules, see <<algo_edg, edg>> or <<rbc_adj, adj>>.
