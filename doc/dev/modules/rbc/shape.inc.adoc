= shape

Helper for stress free state.
Compute membrane quantities on host.

Allocate, deallocate structure:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/rbc/shape/imp.h[tag=mem]
----

where the positions `rr` are stored in a AoS fashion `x0 y0 z0 x1 y1
z1 ...`. Also needs <<rbc_adj, adjacency structure>> as input.

Compute quantities (on host):

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/rbc/shape/imp.h[tag=int]
----
<1> compute edge lengths (order: see `Adj` module
<2> compute area of triangles
<3> compute total area
<4> compute total volume
