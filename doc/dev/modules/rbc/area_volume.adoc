----
<1> initialization, `nv`, `nt`, `tt`: number of vertices, number of
triangles, a triangle structure *on host*, `max_nm` is a maximum
allowed number of meshes
<2> compute area and volume for every mesh, `nm` is a number of meshes,
output `av` is a devices array and is as follow
----
area[0] volume[0] ... area[nc-1] volume[nc-1]
----
<3> after `area_volume_compute` call, `area_volume_host` returns a
host version of `av` array
