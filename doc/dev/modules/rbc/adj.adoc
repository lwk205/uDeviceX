= mesh adjacency structure

Consider closed triangulated mesh with `nv` vertices. Degree of a
vertex is the number of edges incident to the vertex. Let `md` is a
maximum degree of the vertices. To compute forces in one membrane
_uDeviceX_ launches `nv * md` threads each thread adds forces to only
one vertices.  There are three types of forces: edge forces which
depend on two vertices, triangle forces which depend on three
vertices, and dihedral forces which depend of four vertices (edge and
two adjusting triangles). `Adj_v` has an API call which allow for a
given thread ID find indises of the vertices to use in force
computation.
