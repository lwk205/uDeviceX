[[sim_walls]]
= walls

:base: {src}/sim/walls

Helper to manage solid walls.

Allocate, deallocate the structure:

[source, cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=mem]
----

Generate from solvent particles:

[source, cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=gen]
----

Alternatively, can be generated from restart files:

[source, cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=strt]
----

The restart file is dumped by calling

[source, cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=dump]
----

Interactions with other quantities are possible with the functions

[source, cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=main]
----

The wall velocity can be updated in time with

[source, cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=upd]
----

Getter functions:

[source, cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=get]
----
<1> get a pointer to <<sdf>> object
<2> compute the volume inside the walls (where the solvent can be
    located). This is evaluated via Monte Carlo
