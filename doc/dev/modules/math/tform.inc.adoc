== tform: linar coordinate transformation for 3D vector

Transform vector `a[3]` to `b[3]` using

----
    b[X] = s[X]*a[X] + o[X]
    b[Y] = s[Y]*a[Y] + o[Y]
    b[Z] = s[Z]*a[Z] + o[Z]
----
Coefficient `s` and `o` are defined implicitly by API calls.

Set parameters of the transformation, some transfroms are for grids
which are cell centered and defined by low and high boundaries and the
number of cell.

<1> converts vectors `a0` to `a1` and `b0` to `b1`
<2> a chain of two transforms: C(x) is equivalent to 'B(A(x))'
<3> transfrom to a grid: for example, it transfroms `lo` to `-1/2` and `hi` to `n - 1/2`
<4> transfrom from a grid: for example, it transfroms `-1/2` to `lo` and `n - 1/2` to `hi`
<5> grid to grid transform
