= signed distance function (sdf)
:lext: .adoc

:stem: latexmath

The Signed Distance Function (SDF) stem:[S(x, y, z)] is used to give the distance from a
given position to the wall.
The sign of the SDF field tells if the position is inside or outside
the wall.

Conventions:

* stem:[S(x,y,z) < -1] : inside domain, far from wall
* stem:[S(x,y,z) < 0] : inside domain
* stem:[S(x,y,z) = 0] : wall interface
* stem:[S(x,y,z) > 0] : inside wall
* stem:[S(x,y,z) > 1] : inside wall, far from surface

Example of sdf function in 2D:

image::{include}/sdf.png[pdfwidth=70%]

The above example denotes a circular wall of radius 2.
The isosurface stem:[S(x,y,z) = 0] is located at the wall interface.

== interface

allocate, deallocate the structure:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/wall/sdf/imp.h[tag=mem]
----

interface:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/wall/sdf/imp.h[tag=int]
----
<1> generate the sdf field from file "sdf.dat"
<2> get view to be passed to kernels

device interface:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/wall/sdf/dev.h[tag=int]
----
<1> returns true if position is far inside the domain (approximation)
<2> returns the sdf value at given position (linear interpolation)


Bounce back from wall:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/wall/sdf/imp.h[tag=bounce]
----

Sorting tools:
[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/wall/sdf/imp.h[tag=tools]
----
<1> extract wall particles from solvent particles. Solvent particles
    which are not inside the domain are not kept.
<2> label `nc` objects of `nv` particles to inside domain or not.

== components

* `field`: read sdf field from a file
* `bounce`: bounce back particles
* `label`: label which particle stays in bulk, turns into wall, or
  deleted
