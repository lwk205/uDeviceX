= bounce

Particles crossing the wall surface are bounced back into the domain.
We define:

* stem:[\mathbf{r}_0, \mathbf{v}_0] position and velocity before the particle has
  crossed the surface 
* stem:[\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{v}_1] position and velocity after the particle has
  crossed the surface, not bounced back
* stem:[\mathbf{r}_n, \mathbf{v}_n] position and velocity after bounce-back
* stem:[\mathbf{r}_w, \mathbf{v}_w] position and velocity of the wall
  at collision point

The collision point is found by solving for the collision time stem:[h]

[stem]
++++
S(\mathbf{r}_0 + h \mathbf{v}_0) = 0
++++

with Newton iterations.
We obtain stem:[\mathbf{r}_w = \mathbf{r}_0 + h \mathbf{v}_0].

The bounced particle is set to

[stem]
++++
\mathbf{r}_n = \mathbf{r}_w + (dt - h) \mathbf{v}_n \\
\mathbf{v}_n = 2 \mathbf{v}_w - \mathbf{v}_0
++++
