[[wall_force]]
= force

compute interaction forces between frozen wall particles and other particles.

interface:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/wall/force/imp.h[tag=int]
----
<1> pairwise interactions: input particles with frozen particles
<2> field interaction: input particles get force stem:[\mathbf{f}(s)],
    where stem:[s] is the sdf value at position of input particle.

The helper structure `WallForce` acts as a view to be passed to
the kernel. It is defined as:

[source,cpp]

include::{src}/wall/force/imp.h[tag=struct]

The repulsive force stem:[\mathbf{f}] is computed as:

[stem]
++++
\mathbf{f}(s) = - \mathbf{\nabla} s \; \phi(s),
++++

where

[stem]
++++
\phi = \exp \left[ \lambda (s + 1) \right] - 1,
++++

when stem:[s>-1]  and 0 otherwise. For stem:[\lambda = 1]:
