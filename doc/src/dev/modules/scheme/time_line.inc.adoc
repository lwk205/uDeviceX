= Time line

Manage simulation time.

Allocate, deallocate structure:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/scheme/time_line/imp.h[tag=mem]
----

Manipulate time:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/scheme/time_line/imp.h[tag=int]
----
<1> advance time by `dt` (should be called at every time step)
<2> return `true` if there exist integer `n` such that `n*interval`
    is in between current and previous times, in other words has the
    simulation just crossed `n*interval` for some `n`.

Getters:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/scheme/time_line/imp.h[tag=get]
----
<1> get current time
<2> get iteration id

The time structure can also be initialised via <<io_restart, restart>> mechanism:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/scheme/time_line/imp.h[tag=strt]
----
<1> dump time line state to a restart file in text format
<2> read restart file to initialize time line state
