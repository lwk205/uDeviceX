:base: {src}/sim

manages all modules together to run a simulation

== interface

Allocate and deallocate the structure

[source, cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=mem]
----

Run simulation:

[source, cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=run]
----
<1> run from scratch: this will generate all quantities in two stages
    (solvent only, equilibrating; freezing stage, adding walls and solutes)
<2> run from restart files
