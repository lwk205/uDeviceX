Generic force array to be passed to interaction kernels.
Implemented versions:

* forces only
* forces and stresses

== host interface

A `FoArray` structure can be configured by pushing forces and,
optionally, stresses:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=push]
----
WARNING: Forces must be pushed before stresses

Client can check if the stresses has been pushed by calling

[source,cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=get]
----

The force array data are meant to be passed to kernels.
In order to inline the forces computations mode (see device interface), different
views can be generated from the `FoArray` structure:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{base}/imp.h[tag=view]
----
<1> Get a view to compute forces only
<2> Get a view to compute forces and stresses


== device interface

Generic forces (see _pair_ module) can be added to the generic force
array depending on the view type:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{base}/dev.h[tag=add]
----
<1> add forces only to the array
<2> add forces and stresse to the array

The template parameter `S` is the sign, must be either `-1` or `1`.
Note that it only affects the forces, stresses are always added with
positive sign, as opposed to forces.

For equivalent atomic operations, the following functions can be called:
[source,cpp]
----
include::{base}/dev.h[tag=atomic]
----

The generic Force structure can be initialised to 0 based on the type
of the Generic array:
[source,cpp]
----
include::{base}/dev.h[tag=ini]
----
