Exchange quantities across nodes for "ghost particles".

A quantity is exchanged with a neighboring node if its position is
within a given distance from the subdomain boundaries.

The workflow is very similar for every quantity to exchange:

* build a map from the positions of the quatities and store it in a
  `Map` structure.
* pack the data using `Map` in a `Pack` structure
* communicaion: exchange packed data with neighbors, receive data into
  `Unpack` structure. This is done using the
  link:comm{lext}[generic communicator].
* Unpack the data from `Unpack` to quantities.

Optionally, other quantities can be exchanged back, e.g. forces.
