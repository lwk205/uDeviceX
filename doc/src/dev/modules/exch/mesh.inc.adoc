= mesh

exchange full mesh particles with neighbouring nodes when bounding box
of the mesh crosses or is close enough to the subdomain boundaries.
This is used for mesh bounce back or solvent recoloring.

It can optionally send back momentum data per triangles to original node.

== mesh exchanger interface

allocate, deallocate:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/exch/mesh/imp.h[tag=mem]
----

build map:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/exch/mesh/imp.h[tag=map]
----

pack data:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/exch/mesh/imp.h[tag=pack]
----

communicate data with neigbours:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/exch/mesh/imp.h[tag=com]
----

unpack the data to a single particle array:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/exch/mesh/imp.h[tag=unpack]
----

the returned value `nmhalo` is the number of
received meshes

get number of mesh per fragment:

----

== back momentum sender interface

allocate, deallocate the optional structures:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/exch/mesh/imp.h[tag=memback]
----

pack the momentum infos

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/exch/mesh/imp.h[tag=packback]
----

communicate back the momentum infos:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/exch/mesh/imp.h[tag=comback]
----

unpack the momentum infos to a single array:
