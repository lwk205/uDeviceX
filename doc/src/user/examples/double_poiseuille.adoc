= double_poiseuille

Reverse poiseuille flow in a periodic box.
The setup looks really like the previous case
<<example_equilibration>>, but we now add body forces:

[{CFG}]
----
include::{examples}/double_poiseuille/conf.cfg[tag=force]
----
<1> type of body force
<2> magnitude of the body force

Note that we also need to activate the `push` option for solvent:

[{CFG}]
----
include::{examples}/double_poiseuille/conf.cfg[tag=flu]
----
<1> activate body force for solvent


In order to visualize the flow, we choose here to dump field data.
The data is sampled via the sampling module, activated when the field
dump is active.

[{CFG}]
----
include::{examples}/double_poiseuille/conf.cfg[tag=field]
----
<1> number of samples per dump
<2> refinement of the grid to sample in each direction  (default is 1)
<3> frequency of diagnosis (in dpd time units)
<4> activeate the field dumps
<5> frequency of field dumps (in dpd time units)
